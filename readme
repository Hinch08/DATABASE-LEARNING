A database is a structured  of collection data.

TYPES OF DATABASES.
-Relational Databases.
-Non relational databases.

1.RELATIONAL DATABASES.(SQL)
-Data are stored in related tables(ROWS and COLUMNS)
-Examples of these databases:POSTGRES,MYSQL,SQLITE,ORACLE,SQLSERVER.
-They are related bcoz one has to come from the parent and the other the child.

2.NON-RELATIONAL DATABASES.
-It is a flexible data models not just tables.(They don't have to be related)
-Examples:MONGO_DB,CASSANDRA_DB,REDDISDB,Hbase,FIREBASE,MARIA_DB.

           RELATIONAL DATABASE(SQL)
-SQL(structured query language).
-structured(stores data in rows and columns) 
-query:key words used to interact with a database.(A request in an action)

           KEY CONCEPTS TO UNDERSTAND DATABASE.(CRUD)

2. QUERIES.

           EXCEL.
-A workbook in excel is a database in SQL.
-click on a blank workbook.
-it opens a blank worksheet.
-A worksheet in excel is a table in SQL.
-The worksheet contains Rows and Columns.
-In excel ROWS are marked with NUMERIC VALUES.
-COLUMNS are marked with ALPHABETICAL CHARACTERS.
-A CELL is where a row and a column meet.
-At the bottom of the excel there is something called sheet1,rename it to school_db
-
      SCHOOL_DATABASE
-students.(names,admission numbers,class,age,gender)
-staff.(name,contact_id,role,salary,age,gender)
-school items(accessories)(name,quantity,price)
-Results(students marks)(admission_number,maths,eng,kisw,pt,total marks,Average,grade,remarks)
-subjects.()
-geting the total =
=sum(B2:F2,#then click enter)  

                    GRADING.
       70=>DISTINCTION
       50>70=>CREDIT
       40=PASS
       ELSE:FAILED.
 =IF(H2>70,"Distinction",IF(H2>50,"Credit",IF(H2>40,"PASS","FAIL")))
 =Distinction=>Excellent
 =CREDIT=>GOOD
 =PASS=>AVERAGE needs improvement
 =Fail=>Retake
 =IF(I4="Distinction","Excellent",IF(I4="Credit","Good",IF(I4="Pass","Average needs improvement","FAIL")))

        RELATED WORKSHEETS IN EXCEL
-A workbook in excel is a database in SQL.
-Worksheets in excel are tables in SQL.
-students can work with results therefore we link the two worksheets.
-
       SALES MANAGEMENT DATABASE.
       -products(parent worksheet)(id,name,buyingprice,selling price,quantity)
       -customers(parent worksheet)(id,name,contact,email,address)
       -supplies(parent worksheet)(id,name,contact,email,address)
       -employees(parent worksheet)(id,name,role,contact,salary)
       -sales (child worksheet)(saledate,product_id,customer_id,quantity,total_amount)


       E.R.D(ENTITY RELATIONSHIP DIAGRAM)
-An entity is a database table.
-relationships are connections btwn tables.
-Diagram isa a visual representation of how tables are related.
-ERD is a visual representation of how tables are related in a database.(with entities,ATTRIBUTES and relationships)
-attributes are basically columns in the database.
-parent entitities.-Can a exist without another table.
-child entitiets.->cannot exist without the parent table.

                 RELATIONSHIPS
                 -how entities are related to one another.

                 Types of relationships.
                 -one to one relationships.
                 ->relationship whereby one record in parent is related to only 1 record in child.(order and orderdetails).
                 ->one user one customer
                 
                 -one to many relationships
                 ->one record in the parent table are related to multiple records in the child table.
                 ->e.g pickup to deliveries.
                 ->branch to departments.
                 ->categories to multiple products
                 
                 -many to many relationships
                 ->many records on parents table are recorded to many in the childs table.


                 PRIMARY KEY.
                 -A column in every table used to uniquely identify a row in a table.

                 FOREIGN KEY.
                 -A column in every childs table and its also the primary key in the parents table.


      SQL QUERIES.
-Are used to interract with SQL databases.
-Interract with these databases,read data in the database.
-C.R.U.D(create,read,update,delete)
-create:creating a database.
-read:fetching data from the database table.
->We use the key word SELECT followed the columns u want to display then the FROM key word then the table.
-assume we have a table called students.
SELECT * from students;
select *from table_name;#select from table
select customername,customerid from customers;
->Where clause 
->used to write conditions in a query.
-select * from table_name where condition
exapmle:SELECT * FROM Customers where country="Brazil";
from W3 schools display customers coming fro london;
#select * from customers where city="London";
#select * from customers where city="london" or city="newyork";
#select * from customers where orderid
      BETWEEN (RANGE)
-between is used in condition to specify range
select*fromtable_name where column_name bewteen x and y;
example:select * from products where price between 10 and 20;
select * from products where price not between 10 and 100;

      LIKE AND NOT LIKE
-works with wildcats.
-%means single,multiple, or none characters.
-means single characters.
select*from products where product name like '%'
select*from products where product name like '%a'#ends with a
select *from products where products name like 'a%' #starts with a
select * from products where products name like '%a%'

-orderby(placing on acertain order)
-groupby(placing as a whole in a an ascending order)
select categoryid count(*)
->used to group rows that have the same value.

-orderdetails.
->total number of orderdetails for each products.

SELECT sum(quantity) from orderdetails;

SELECT count(productid)from products where price >25;

SELECT OrderID, SUM(Quantity) AS [Total Quantity]
FROM OrderDetails
GROUP BY OrderID;

SUM and JOINTS.

dsiplay products in ascending orders.
selct *from products order by categoryid 

#exercise on group by

-select categoryid,count(*)as no_products from products group by categoryid order by count(*) ASC;(ARRANGING FROM THE SMALLEST TO THE LARGEST).
-select shippersid,count(*)as total_orders from orders group by shipperid order by count(*) desc;
-select employeeid,count(*) as no_orders from orders group by employeeid order by count(*);
-select  supplierid,count(*)as number_products from products group by supplierid order by count(*) desc;
