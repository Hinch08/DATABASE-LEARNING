A database is a structured  of collection data.

TYPES OF DATABASES.
-Relational Databases.
-Non relational databases.

1.RELATIONAL DATABASES.(SQL)
-Data are stored in related tables(ROWS and COLUMNS)
-Examples of these databases:POSTGRES,MYSQL,SQLITE,ORACLE,SQLSERVER.
-They are related bcoz one has to come from the parent and the other the child.

2.NON-RELATIONAL DATABASES.
-It is a flexible data models not just tables.(They don't have to be related)
-Examples:MONGO_DB,CASSANDRA_DB,REDDISDB,Hbase,FIREBASE,MARIA_DB.

           RELATIONAL DATABASE(SQL)
-SQL(structured query language).
-structured(stores data in rows and columns) 
-query:key words used to interact with a database.(A request in an action)

           KEY CONCEPTS TO UNDERSTAND DATABASE.(CRUD)
1. ERD(ENTITY RELATIONSHIPS DIAGRAM)(DRAWING)
2. QUERIES.

           EXCEL.
-A workbook in excel is a database in SQL.
-click on a blank workbook.
-it opens a blank worksheet.
-A worksheet in excel is a table in SQL.
-The worksheet contains Rows and Columns.
-In excel ROWS are marked with NUMERIC VALUES.
-COLUMNS are marked with ALPHABETICAL CHARACTERS.
-A CELL is where a row and a column meet.
-At the bottom of the excel there is something called sheet1,rename it to school_db
-
      SCHOOL_DATABASE
-students.(names,admission numbers,class,age,gender)
-staff.(name,contact_id,role,salary,age,gender)
-school items(accessories)(name,quantity,price)
-Results(students marks)(admission_number,maths,eng,kisw,pt,total marks,Average,grade,remarks)
-subjects.()
-geting the total =
=sum(B2:F2,#then click enter)  

                    GRADING.
       70=>DISTINCTION
       50>70=>CREDIT
       40=PASS
       ELSE:FAILED.
 =IF(H2>70,"Distinction",IF(H2>50,"Credit",IF(H2>40,"PASS","FAIL")))
 =Distinction=>Excellent
 =CREDIT=>GOOD
 =PASS=>AVERAGE needs improvement
 =Fail=>Retake
 =IF(I4="Distinction","Excellent",IF(I4="Credit","Good",IF(I4="Pass","Average needs improvement","FAIL")))

        RELATED WORKSHEETS IN EXCEL
-A workbook in excel is a database in SQL.
-Worksheets in excel are tables in SQL.
-students can work with results therefore we link the two worksheets.
-
       SALES MANAGEMENT DATABASE.
       -products(parent worksheet)(id,name,buyingprice,selling price,quantity)
       -customers(parent worksheet)(id,name,contact,email,address)
       -supplies(parent worksheet)(id,name,contact,email,address)
       -employees(parent worksheet)(id,name,role,contact,salary)
       -sales (child worksheet)(saledate,product_id,customer_id,quantity,total_amount)


       E.R.D(ENTITY RELATIONSHIP DIAGRAM)
-An entity is a database table.
-relationships are connections btwn tables.
-Diagram isa a visual representation of how tables are related.
-ERD is a visual representation of how tables are related in a database.(with entities,ATTRIBUTES and relationships)
-attributes are basically columns in the database.
-parent entitities.-Can a exist without another table.
-child entitiets.->cannot exist without the parent table.

                 RELATIONSHIPS
                 -how entities are related to one another.

                 -one to one relationships.
                 ->relationship whereby one record in parent is related to only 1 record in child.(order and orderdetails).
                 ->one user one customer
                 
                 -one to many relationships
                 ->one record in the parent table are related to multiple records in the child table.
                 ->e.g pickup to deliveries.
